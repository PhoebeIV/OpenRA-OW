# What is Opposing Worlds?

Opposing Worlds is a mod originally conceived in the early 2010s to introduce C&C Dawn into RA. 
Over the years, it has incorporated a number of original factions and ideas, and plenty of heavily inspired stuff from other games. As well as lots of injokes and memes, as it has been a fairly closed knit private group for quite a long time.

Features:

* 13 new factions, along with subfactions for most of them!
* Avali faction?!
* Improvements to both Allies and Soviet, with Allies being given a unique superweapon, the Weather Machine!
* 2 new tech levels, Advanced Tech and Super Tech, with structures placed into their own unique production queue tab.
* A new utility production tab for walls, gates and other support buildings.
* Upgrades! You can buy upgrades for your army and or base to improve their performance!
* Super or Epic units! Essentially a very powerful hero unit that is limited to 1 active at a time.
* Also Super support powers! For some factions.
* Improved tech buildings, particularly the Communications Centre and Forward Command
* A huge number of new, and at times silly crate effects!
* New lobby options to play around with, including Indestructible Bridges, or disabling upgrades!
* An 'enhanced', or rather, cheaty AI that actually makes them a challenge fighting against or having them as allies. Except for Easy.
* New AI options to artificially make them harder than expected or more like a player, ie. the "Death Box" pillbox building, prefilled APCs, and so on.
* Some new [engine stuff](https://github.com/PhoebeIV/OpenRA-Engine) that allow us to do things not normally possible in the base OpenRA engine. With a big thanks to [Attacque Superior](https://github.com/AttacqueSuperior) for most of the new traits.
* A small few new multiplayer maps, but mostly edits of existing ones.

We've done our best to keep this many factions as balanced as possible, but that's hard and can be difficult to test.

Here is a summary of the factions:

* The Federation: an original faction created by one of our modders, MinesaeHiromu. They focus on superior firepower and technology.
* United Aerospace Corporation (UAC): a faction inspired by and using sprites and sounds from the classic DooM I and II games.
* The Third Reich: Look who's back! A mostly original faction that uses elements from both the original Allies and Soviet factions. This faction uses sprites from Wolfenstein 3D.
* C&C Tiberium: with Nod and GDI, along with additional ideas, TS and C&C3 including some sub factions.
* C&C Generals: the USA, GLA and China factions, along with their sub factions.
* Medieval: a faction based on middle ages with plenty of fantasy elements like dragons and magic. 
* StarCraft 1: the Zerg, Protoss and the Terrans, with no sub factions at this stage. We did our best to mimic their unique build and play styles as well, with Zerg requiring the most micro management! You have an option to change it back to traditional build mode, too.
* Civilians: a support faction, designed to help other players with their abundance of resource gathering and other utilities. Think of it as like you're just chillin', playin' SimCity... that is, until the AI decides that your nice little houses are too valuable, and nukes them.
