## What is Opposing Worlds?

Opposing Worlds is a mod originally conceived to introduce C&C Dawn into RA. Over the years, it has incorporated a number of original factions and ideas, and plenty of heavily inspired stuff from other games.

* The Federation: an original faction created by one of our modders, MinesaeHiromu.
* United Aerospace Corporation (UAC): a faction inspired by and using sprites and sounds from the classic DooM I and II games.
* C&C Tiberium: with Nod and GDI, along with ideas from TD, TS and C&C3 including some sub factions.
* C&C Generals: the USA, GLA and China factions, along with their sub factions. 
* StarCraft: the Zerg, Protoss and the Terrans, with no sub factions at this stage.
* Civilians: a support faction, designed to help other players with their abundance of resource gathering and other utilities.
